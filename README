My diploma thesis, ``Integrating Maude into Hets''.

To build the PDF, I used:
* Hets, at least version 0.95, to pretty-print `.het` files
* Maude, possibly
* Plan9 from User Space, specifically
  + mk to script the build
  + sam to "fix" pretty-printed specifications with logic Maude
* LaTeX and BibTeX, obviously

I used XeTeX and the TeX Gyre fonts.
